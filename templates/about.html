I am a 5th year PhD student at Georgia Tech advised by <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/">Prof. Devi Parikh</a>. I also work closely with <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dbatra/">Prof. Dhruv Batra</a>. My thesis revolves around building algorithms that provide explanations for decisions emanating from deep networks in order to â€” </p>

    <!-- can perceive and reason based on multimodal sensory information, are interpretable so that decisions or predictions made by such models or systems can be explained as opposed to them being black-boxes and are transferable and robust in the sense that they can be adapted across different domains and problem settings with ease and limited supervision. -->

    <!-- My research interests focus on Semantic Scene Understanding and Artificial Intelligence. I am also interested in the interpretability aspect of Deep Learning models. </p> -->
    <p class="content"> During my undergrad, I had the opportunity to work with <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~phst/">Prof. Philip Torr</a> at Oxford University and <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/bkimia">Prof. Benamin Kimia</a> at Brown University on projects for helping visually impaired people to navigate in everyday environments.

    <p class="content">I love playing all kinds of racquet sports, specifically Badminton, Table Tennis, Tennis, Squash and Racquet ball.</p>
